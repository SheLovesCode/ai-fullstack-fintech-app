# ü§ñ AI Usage Summary

This document outlines how AI tools (ChatGPT, powered by GPT-5) were used during the development of the **AI-Assisted Full-Stack Fintech App**. The project was developed using **PyCharm** for backend work and **WebStorm** for frontend development, both of which provided intelligent autocomplete and code suggestions that complemented GPT‚Äôs assistance throughout the process.

## üß≠ Purpose of AI Assistance

AI was used to streamline development, validate architectural decisions, and accelerate repetitive coding tasks while ensuring security, observability, and reliability remained central to the implementation. GPT acted as a coding assistant, helping draft and refine components, while all outputs were manually reviewed, tested, and adjusted where necessary.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Areas of AI Contribution

### 1. Project Architecture & Design

Based on my previous experience, after reviewing the project brief, I outlined to GPT the most important priorities ‚Äî **security, observability, and error handling**. I knew from the start that I wanted a **modular code organization** to keep the backend, frontend, and configuration layers cleanly separated. To minimize CORS issues and simplify deployment, I decided early on to use **NGINX as a reverse proxy** and **fully dockerize** the project. GPT then assisted in setting up the initial directory structure and configuration files according to these architectural decisions, ensuring consistency across all services from the start.

### üêõ Debugging the New Way

During development, I used ChatGPT to triage and investigate the root causes of errors. While its suggested solutions were not always 100% correct, they helped me quickly narrow down the potential source of issues, saving the time I would have otherwise spent combing through StackOverflow threads and GitHub issues line by line. This approach allowed me to isolate problems faster, test hypotheses more efficiently, and refine error handling with greater confidence, all while keeping full control over the final solution.

### 2. Backend Development

For the backend, I used GPT to help design and refine the **FastAPI** service that handles authentication, payouts, and webhook updates. I described the required flow ‚Äî including Google OAuth login, payout creation, idempotency enforcement, and webhook handling ‚Äî and GPT generated structured endpoints and Pydantic models that fit those specifications. I reviewed and adjusted each suggestion to match best practices for input validation, data typing, and error handling. Throughout development, PyCharm‚Äôs autocomplete complemented GPT‚Äôs output by suggesting relevant imports, type hints, and docstring completions.

---

### 3. Frontend Development

On the frontend, I used GPT to help implement the **React (TypeScript)** single-page application, focusing on payout creation, pagination, and live status updates. I explained that I wanted a clean, modern UI using **Material UI** and **React Hook Form**, with notifications handled via **React Toastify**. GPT generated initial code for the payout form, transaction table, and pagination controls, which I refined to ensure proper validation, UX flow, and API integration. WebStorm‚Äôs built-in AI-assisted autocomplete made this process smoother by automatically suggesting JSX attributes, type completions, and hooks, reducing repetitive edits.

---

### 4. Deployment & Configuration

I prompted GPT to help write a **Docker Compose** configuration that tied together the backend, database, mock payment service, and NGINX. I wanted a setup that mirrored a production environment, so GPT provided a base configuration which I modified for environment separation, health checks, and volume persistence. For NGINX, GPT helped me define a reverse proxy setup that served the React frontend and routed API calls to FastAPI under the `/api/` path. All generated configurations were manually tested and refined to ensure routing, CORS, and service dependencies worked as intended.

---

### 5. Documentation & Testing

GPT helped generate clear, well-structured documentation, including the `README.md`, `postman_collection.json`, and this `ai_usage.md`. I described the need for professional, end-to-end clarity that would make the project easy to set up and understand. GPT assisted in organizing the README sections, creating concise explanations of key flows, and highlighting security considerations. Additionally, GPT suggested minimal tests for verifying idempotency and webhook signature validation, which I implemented and reviewed manually. All documentation was finalized through human review to maintain tone consistency and technical accuracy.

---

## üß™ Validation & Human Oversight

All AI-generated code and documentation were reviewed for correctness, readability, and alignment with the project‚Äôs goals. I manually tested all routes, frontend interactions, and Docker setups to confirm that GPT‚Äôs output worked as expected. Wherever AI suggestions conflicted with real-world configurations or failed to handle edge cases, I refactored and validated them through manual testing and debugging.

---

## üîí Maintaining Security & Coding Integrity

Throughout development, I ensured that sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets, were never shared with ChatGPT. Additionally, only small portions of code, such as function definitions, boilerplate, and error messages, were shared with the tools. These precautions helped maintain a high level of security and coding integrity while still benefiting from AI-assisted suggestions and completions. This approach ensured that all confidential data remained protected and that generated code could be safely reviewed and integrated manually.

---

## üìò Summary

GPT served as a **supportive coding assistant**, helping accelerate development, generate structured code, and suggest improvements without replacing human judgment. By combining AI assistance with **PyCharm** and **WebStorm**‚Äôs autocomplete and documentation features, the project maintained a balance of speed, reliability, and maintainability. All code, configuration, and documentation were reviewed and adjusted manually to ensure alignment with security, observability, and modular architecture principles. The final system demonstrates a human-led approach that leverages AI efficiently while retaining full control over design, implementation, and validation.
